# Parakeeb Keyboard

A staggered, ortholinear board featuring pretty PCB art and a split 50-key
layout.

The board is designed for ProMicro controllers and requires soldering SMD
diodes. It uses Kailh choc switches and their corresponding "narrow" keycap
footprint (i.e. 17.5 x 16.5 mm - standard Cherry spacing of 18 x 18 mm will
not fit).

The board is reversible and switches can be mounted on either side, and/or
the ProMicro can be soldered upside down. A different firmware has to be
flashed depending on the orientation.
